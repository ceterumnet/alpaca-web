# BUGS:

- [ ] devicestate is not implemented on all of the alpaca features. Need to audit and create a list of the alpaca device implementations that don't have this
- [ ] cover calibrator does not appear to be invoking the correct alpaca methods potentially. need to review what is going on here
- [x] safety panel is not working
- [x] filter wheel is not working correctly
