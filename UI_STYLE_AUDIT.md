### CSS Variables Usage

#### From colors.css (current definition)

| Variable           | Definition | Used In             | Inconsistencies                               |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| --aw-primary-color | #4a7adc    | Multiple components | Some components use `--color-primary` instead |
| --aw-primary-light | #789fea    | Rarely used         | Often hardcoded or missing from components    |
| --aw-primary-dark  | #3a5fbc    | Button hover states | Some components use hardcoded darker variants |
| --aw-accent-color  | #5b9bd5    | Rarely used         | Most accent styling is hardcoded              |
| --aw-bg-color      | #f5f7fa    | App.vue, base.css   | Some components use `--color-background`      |

### Theme Implementation

The current dark theme implements a red color scheme, which is **critical for astronomy applications**:

- The red-themed dark mode is essential for preserving night vision during astronomical observations
- Red light has minimal impact on dark adaptation compared to other colors
- This feature must be maintained, but needs consistent implementation across components
- Many components don't properly support this astronomy-focused dark theme
- There are inconsistencies in how the red theme is applied across the application

### Implementation Approach

Our revised approach will:

1. Maintain the red-themed dark mode for astronomy purposes
2. Standardize the implementation across all components
3. Create a structured design token system with proper red-theme mapping
4. Ensure all components properly support the astronomy night mode
5. Fix inconsistencies in variable naming and usage

### Revised Design Token Structure

Based on the audit and the need to preserve the astronomy-focused red theme, we've created a design token structure with the following characteristics:

1. Light theme: Blue primary color scheme with neutral grays
2. Dark theme: Red-based astronomy-focused theme for night vision preservation
3. Structured naming system with categories and variants
4. Proper inheritance between base and semantic tokens

```css
/* Example of the astronomy-focused dark theme */
:root .dark-theme {
  /* Base colors - red-based dark theme for astronomy */
  --aw-color-neutral-50: #2d1010; /* Darkest background */
  --aw-color-neutral-100: #1a0808; /* Main background */
  --aw-color-neutral-200: #220808; /* Secondary background */
  --aw-color-neutral-300: #5a1818; /* Borders */
  --aw-color-neutral-400: #7a2020; /* Secondary UI elements */
  --aw-color-neutral-500: #902828; /* Mid-level UI elements */
  --aw-color-neutral-600: #d0a0a0; /* Secondary text */
  --aw-color-neutral-700: #e0b0b0; /* Primary text for dark elements */
  --aw-color-neutral-800: #f0d0d0; /* Primary text */
  --aw-color-neutral-900: #f8e0e0; /* High contrast text */

  /* Primary colors - red theme for astronomy */
  --aw-color-primary-300: #d45a5a;
  --aw-color-primary-500: #b53f3f; /* Main brand color in dark mode */
  --aw-color-primary-700: #8b2020;
}
```
