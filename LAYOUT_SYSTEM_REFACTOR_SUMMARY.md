# Layout System Refactor & Simplification – Summary

## Goals

- Provide a user-friendly way to select from a set of static, pre-defined layouts.
- Ensure the layout selection UI is clean, modern, and integrated into the main navigation bar.
- Decouple device assignment from the layout selection process (panels handle device selection).

---

## Key Changes

### 1. **Static Layout Chooser**

- Created a set of static layout templates (2x2, 1x2, 3x2, hybrid 50/50, hybrid 60/40).
- Each layout is defined as a grid (rows, columns, cell structure).
- Device assignment is not part of the layout selection; panels handle device selection.

### 2. **Navigation Bar Integration**

- The layout control in the navigation bar shows a "Choose Layout" button.
- Clicking the button opens a centered modal overlay with all static layout thumbnails.
- Clicking a thumbnail immediately applies the layout and closes the modal.

### 3. **PanelLayoutView & Device Assignment**

- No extra layout controls or modals in the main panel view.
- Device assignment is handled through universal device selectors in each panel.
- Each cell in the layout can display any type of device panel based on user selection.

### 4. **Universal Panel System**

- Added a flexible panel system that dynamically renders the appropriate component based on device type.
- Each cell now features a device selector dropdown with all available devices.
- Panels automatically adapt to show the correct device interface based on the selected device.
- Device selections are persisted when switching between layouts.

### 5. **Type Safety & Linting**

- All new code is type-safe and linter-clean.
- Interfaces for layouts and cells are used throughout.

## User Experience

- **Using Layouts**:
  - Click "Choose Layout" in the Nav bar.
  - See a modal with layout thumbnails.
  - Click a layout to apply it instantly.
- **Device Selection**:
  - Each panel has its own device selector dropdown.
  - Select any device from the dropdown to display its control interface.
  - Device types are automatically detected and the appropriate panel component is rendered.

## Known Issues

- **Layout Rendering Issues**: Several layout rendering problems persist.
  - Notes: We need to look at aw-layout-container_grid and the grid-template-rows css.
  - **1x2 Layout**: The cells are only rendering to half of the available screen real estate - likely related to the grid-template-rows CSS value
  - **3x2 Layout**: The bottom 2 cells are very short

## Implemented Fixes

- **Layout Reactivity**: Fixed the reactivity issue when switching between layouts. Layouts now update immediately without requiring a page refresh.
- **Layout Container**: Enhanced the LayoutContainer component to better handle layout changes by adding keys for proper re-rendering.
- **Component Synchronization**: Improved coordination between the NavigationBar, PanelLayoutView, and LayoutContainer components to ensure consistent layout updates.
- **Panel Content Display**: Implemented a universal device selection system that allows any cell to display any type of device panel:
  - Added device type propagation from cells to panel positions
  - Created cell-to-device assignments to track which devices are shown in which cells
  - Implemented automatic device initialization based on layout device types
  - Added dynamic panel rendering based on device type
  - Improved empty state handling for unassigned cells
- **Hybrid Layout Improvements**:
  - Modified convertStaticToRows function to properly handle cells with rowSpan
  - Enhanced gridToPositionLayout to track occupied positions
  - Added special handling for bottom-right cell in hybrid layouts
  - Added explicit styles and debugging information to improve rendering
  - Despite these improvements, some rendering issues persist (see Known Issues)
- **Codebase Simplification**:
  - Removed the custom layout capabilities
  - Simplified the code by removing the toggle between Simple and Advanced modes
  - Focused the UI on simple static layouts only

---

## Next Steps / Future Improvements

- Address current layout rendering issues across all layout types
- Add thumbnail previews with device types for improved visualization
- Allow editing or extending the set of static layouts
- Further decouple device type from layout structure for even more flexibility
- Add keyboard navigation or accessibility improvements to the modal
- Implement device state persistence between sessions
- Add support for more device types and custom panels
- Rebuild custom layout capabilities on top of the grid system once core issues are fixed
