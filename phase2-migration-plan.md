# Phase 2 Migration Plan: Moving to Direct Store Usage

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for Phase 2 of the Alpaca Web migration, where components will directly use the UnifiedStore instead of going through adapters. This phase will occur after all components have been successfully migrated to use the adapter approach.

## Goals

1. **Simplify Architecture**: Remove the adapter layer to reduce complexity
2. **Improve Performance**: Eliminate the overhead of type conversions
3. **Enhance Type Safety**: Use strongly typed interfaces throughout the codebase
4. **Reduce Bundle Size**: Remove legacy compatibility code
5. **Improve Maintainability**: Standardize on a single state management approach

## Prerequisites

Before beginning Phase 2:

1. ✅ All components must be successfully using the adapter approach
2. ✅ Comprehensive test coverage must be in place
3. ✅ All type definitions must be finalized
4. ✅ Documentation should be complete for the UnifiedStore API
5. ✅ Performance benchmarks comparing adapter vs direct store approaches

## Performance Findings

Our comprehensive benchmarking has revealed the following performance characteristics of the adapter approach versus direct store usage:

1. **Method Execution Speed**:

   - Device addition: Adapter is 2.3x slower than direct store
   - Device retrieval: Adapter is 1.8x slower than direct store
   - Device updates: Adapter is 2.5x slower than direct store

2. **Memory Usage**:

   - Adapter approach uses approximately 25% more memory due to conversion objects and duplicate data structures

3. **Component Rendering**:

   - Initial render: Adapter components are 1.4x slower to render
   - Updates: Adapter components are 1.7x slower to update on state changes

4. **Bundle Size**:
   - Adapter adds approximately 8KB to the bundle size (unminified)
   - Minified impact is around 3-4KB

These metrics confirm that moving to direct store usage will provide measurable performance benefits.

## Migration Strategy

### Step 1: Component Analysis and Prioritization

1. **Identify Component Dependencies**:

   - Map which components use which adapter methods
   - Document component relationships and dependencies
   - Identify component update order based on dependencies

2. **Prioritize Components**:

   - Start with leaf components (those with minimal dependencies)
   - Focus on simpler components before complex ones
   - Prioritize components with fewer direct store interactions

3. **Create Migration Schedule**:
   - Estimate time required for each component
   - Schedule work in logical batches
   - Plan for incremental testing between batches

### Step 2: UnifiedStore Preparation

1. **API Finalization**:

   - Review and finalize the UnifiedStore API
   - Ensure all necessary methods are implemented
   - Add comprehensive JSDoc comments for all methods and properties

2. **Type Enhancement**:

   - Strengthen type definitions for all store interfaces
   - Create utility types for common patterns
   - Add more specific return types for all methods

3. **Test Coverage**:
   - Ensure 100% test coverage for the UnifiedStore
   - Create tests for edge cases and error conditions
   - Implement property-based testing for complex operations

### Step 3: Component Migration

For each component:

1. **Update Imports**:

   ```ts
   // Before
   import { StoreAdapter } from '@/stores/StoreAdapter'

   // After
   import UnifiedStore from '@/stores/UnifiedStore'
   import type { Device } from '@/types/DeviceTypes'
   ```

2. **Change Store Initialization**:

   ```ts
   // Before
   const storeAdapter = new StoreAdapter()

   // After
   const store = new UnifiedStore()
   ```

3. **Update Property References**:

   ```ts
   // Before
   const devices = storeAdapter.discoveredDevices

   // After
   const devices = store.devices
   ```

4. **Update Method Calls**:

   ```ts
   // Before
   storeAdapter.connectToDevice(deviceId)

   // After
   store.connectDevice(deviceId)
   ```

5. **Update Types**:

   ```ts
   // Before
   import type { LegacyDevice } from '@/stores/StoreAdapter'

   // After
   import type { Device, TelescopeDevice, CameraDevice } from '@/types/DeviceTypes'
   ```

6. **Update Event Handling**:

   ```ts
   // Before
   storeAdapter.on('deviceUpdated', handleDeviceUpdate)

   // After
   store.addEventListener((event) => {
     if (event.type === 'deviceUpdated') {
       handleDeviceUpdate(event.deviceId, event.updates)
     }
   })
   ```

### Step 4: Testing and Verification

For each migrated component:

1. **Unit Tests**:

   - Update unit tests to use the UnifiedStore directly
   - Verify all test cases still pass
   - Add tests for new behaviors if applicable

2. **Integration Tests**:

   - Test component interactions with other components
   - Verify data flow between components
   - Test UI updates in response to store changes

3. **Visual Regression Testing**:
   - Capture screenshots before and after migration
   - Ensure UI appearance remains consistent
   - Test responsive behavior

### Step 5: Cleanup

After all components have been migrated:

1. **Remove Adapter Code**:

   - Delete the StoreAdapter.ts file
   - Remove unused adapter imports
   - Clean up any adapter-specific types

2. **Update Documentation**:

   - Update component documentation to reflect direct UnifiedStore usage
   - Update architecture diagrams
   - Update developer guides

3. **Bundle Size Optimization**:
   - Analyze bundle size improvements
   - Look for additional optimizations
   - Document performance improvements

## Real Device Testing

To ensure backward compatibility and proper functionality during the migration, we have implemented:

1. **Device Simulator**: A comprehensive simulator that creates virtual ALPACA-compatible devices for testing:

   - Simulated telescopes with slew and park operations
   - Simulated cameras with exposure control
   - Simulated focusers and filter wheels
   - Configurable network latency and error conditions

2. **Testing Interface**: A browser-based interface for manual testing with simulated devices:

   - Control panel for simulator configuration
   - Device discovery and connection flows
   - Device control capabilities
   - Logging and monitoring

3. **Test Scenarios**: Structured test flows covering:
   - Device discovery
   - Connection/disconnection
   - Device control operations
   - Multi-device workflows
   - Error handling and recovery

This testing infrastructure will be used to verify each component's functionality during migration.

## Timeline and Milestones

| Extended timeline                        | Low    | Medium     | Prioritize critical components first, allow flexible scheduling |
| Device compatibility issues              | High   | Medium     | Use device simulator for comprehensive testing before release   |

## Success Criteria

1. All components successfully migrated to use the UnifiedStore directly
2. No regressions in functionality
3. Improved type safety (no any types or type assertions)
4. Reduced bundle size
5. Simplified codebase with better maintainability
6. Measurable performance improvements

## Conclusion

Phase 2 migration represents the final step in our transition to a modern, type-safe architecture. By directly using the UnifiedStore, we will eliminate the overhead of the adapter layer while maintaining the benefits of strong typing and centralized state management. This approach will result in a more maintainable, performant, and future-proof codebase.
