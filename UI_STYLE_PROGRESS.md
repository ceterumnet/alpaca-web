## Key Benefits Achieved

1. **Improved Consistency**: Standardized naming and token usage across components
2. **Better Astronomy Support**: Enhanced red theme implementation for night vision
3. **Enhanced Accessibility**: Improved contrast ratios and focus states
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Clear token structure with semantic meaning
5. **Simplified Development**: Component styles now consistently reference design tokens
6. **Visual Reference**: Showcase provides an "at-a-glance" view of all UI components

## Next Steps
