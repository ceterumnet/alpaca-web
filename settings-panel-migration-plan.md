# SettingsPanel Migration Plan

## Overview

The SettingsPanelMigrated component will provide a centralized interface for users to manage application-wide settings and preferences. This panel will consolidate various settings that are currently managed in different parts of the application, making it easier for users to customize their experience.

## Component Requirements

The SettingsPanelMigrated component will:

1. **User Interface Preferences**

   - Theme management (toggle between light and dark mode)
   - Default view mode for new panels (overview, detailed, or fullscreen)
   - Sidebar visibility and behavior settings
   - Notification display preferences (position, duration, etc.)

2. **Layout Management**

   - Save and load layout presets
   - Configure default panel sizes for different device types
   - Reset all layout preferences to defaults

3. **Application Behavior**

   - Configure auto-connect behavior for devices
   - Set device discovery preferences
   - Configure polling intervals for device updates

4. **Persistent Settings**
   - Save all preferences to localStorage
   - Provide import/export functionality for settings

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Create Component Structure

```vue
<!-- SettingsPanelMigrated.vue -->
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref, reactive } from 'vue'
import { useUIPreferencesStore, UIMode } from '@/stores/useUIPreferencesStore'
import { useLayoutStore } from '@/stores/useLayoutStore'
import { useNotificationStore } from '@/stores/useNotificationStore'
</script>
```

### 2. Store Integration

The component will interact with multiple stores:

- `useUIPreferencesStore` for UI-related settings
- `useLayoutStore` for layout management
- `useNotificationStore` for notification preferences

### 3. Settings Sections

The component will be organized into logical sections:

1. **Appearance** - Theme, colors, and visual preferences
2. **Layout** - Panel layout management and defaults
3. **Devices** - Device connection and discovery behavior
4. **Notifications** - How and where notifications appear
5. **Advanced** - Import/export settings, debug options

## UI Design

The settings panel will feature:

- Tab-based navigation between setting categories
- Form controls appropriate for each setting type
- Real-time preview of visual changes
- Save/cancel buttons for each section
- Responsive design that works well on different screen sizes

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**:

   - Test individual setting controls
   - Verify store integration
   - Test persistence mechanisms

2. **Integration Tests**:

   - Test settings application throughout the app
   - Verify import/export functionality

3. **Accessibility Tests**:
   - Ensure the settings panel is fully keyboard navigable
   - Test with screen readers
   - Verify sufficient color contrast

## Implementation Steps

1. Create the basic component structure
2. Implement theme and UI preference controls
3. Build layout management controls
4. Add device-related settings
5. Implement settings persistence
6. Add import/export functionality
7. Create comprehensive tests
8. Update documentation

## Expected Completion Time

- Basic implementation: 1-2 days
- Testing and refinement: 1 day
- Documentation: 0.5 day
- Total: 2.5-3.5 days
