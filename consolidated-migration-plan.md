# Consolidated Migration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the migration of Vue 2 components using store adapters to Vue 3 components using UnifiedStore directly.

## Migration Progress

- **Batch 1 (Base Components)**: 100% Complete ✅
- **Batch 2 (Device-Specific Components)**: 100% Complete ✅
- **Batch 3 (Complex Composition Components)**: 75% In Progress 🏃‍♂️
  - DiscoveredDevices.vue → DiscoveredDevicesMigrated.vue ✅ (Tests complete)
  - MainPanels.vue → MainPanelsMigrated.vue ✅ (Tests complete)
- **Batch 4 (Specialized Views)**: 33% In Progress 🏃‍♂️
  - DeviceDetailView.vue → DeviceDetailViewMigrated.vue 🏃‍♂️
  - DevicePage.vue → DevicePageMigrated.vue 🏃‍♂️
  - ImageAnalysis.vue → ImageAnalysisMigrated.vue 🏃‍♂️
- **Batch 5 (Peripheral Components)**: 67% In Progress 🏃‍♂️
  - NotificationCenter.vue → NotificationCenterMigrated.vue ✅
  - SettingsPanel.vue → SettingsPanelMigrated.vue 🏃‍♂️
  - ManualDeviceConfig.vue → ManualDeviceConfigMigrated.vue 🏃‍♂️

## Current Focus

The current focus is on completing comprehensive test suites for remaining components and ensuring robust integration:

- Enhancing test coverage for Batch 4 components
- Ensuring all migrated components are properly integrated into the application
- Validating TypeScript type safety across the codebase
- Performing integration testing
- Preparing for final deployment

## Recently Completed

1. **Batch 3 Components**: Enhanced Testing

   - Completed comprehensive test suite for DiscoveredDevicesMigrated.vue
     - Added error handling tests
     - Implemented device filtering tests
     - Added edge case coverage
   - Completed comprehensive test suite for MainPanelsMigrated.vue
     - Implemented layout management tests
     - Added connection state change tests
     - Added device event handling tests

2. **Batch 2 Components**: 100% Complete ✅

   - Completed TelescopePanelMigrated.vue
   - Completed CameraPanelMigrated.vue
   - Completed EnhancedTelescopePanelMigrated.vue
   - Completed EnhancedCameraPanelMigrated.vue

3. **Key Peripheral Components**:
   - Implemented NotificationCenterMigrated.vue ✅
     - Created a centralized notification system with global access
     - Implemented direct UnifiedStore integration for device events
     - Added accessibility features for screen readers and keyboard navigation

## Migration Approach

For each component:

1. Create a detailed migration plan
2. Implement the migrated component with direct UnifiedStore access
3. Create comprehensive tests
4. Update documentation to reflect progress

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for each migrated component
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Mock router and UnifiedStore for isolated component testing
- Test both normal operations and edge cases
- Error handling test coverage for robust component behavior

## Timeline

- Batch 3 components: 75% Complete 🏃‍♂️
- Batch 4 components: In Progress 🏃‍♂️
- Batch 5 components: In Progress 🏃‍♂️
- Final integration and testing: Expected 2 weeks
- Overall project completion: Expected by end of quarter
