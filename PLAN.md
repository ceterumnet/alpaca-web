# Project State Review

## Overview

This document captures the current state of the Alpaca Web project, identifying both strong points and areas that need attention. The project has several well-implemented components but also shows signs of partial implementation and architectural inconsistencies.

## Strong Points

### 1. Alpaca Client Implementation

- Well-designed base client with proper error handling, retry logic, and timeout handling
- Type-safe implementation with comprehensive TypeScript support
- Good separation of concerns between base client and device-specific clients
- Proper handling of ASCOM Alpaca protocol requirements

### 2. Event System

- Robust event system with support for both typed and string-based events
- Event batching capability for performance optimization
- Good type safety for device events
- Clear event flow and documentation

### 3. Panel System Design

- Well-thought-out panel hierarchy (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary features)
- Good device-specific categorization
- Flexible layout system with responsive design
- Clear separation between panel definition and implementation

### 4. New Image Processing Service

- Centralized image processing functionality
- Proper ASCOM Alpaca image format handling
- Efficient image data processing with performance optimizations
- Comprehensive image enhancement capabilities
- Type-safe implementation with clear interfaces

## Areas Needing Attention

### 1. Architecture Cohesion

- **Issue**: The system shows signs of multiple architectural approaches being implemented simultaneously
- **Impact**: Makes it harder to maintain and extend the codebase
- **Recommendation**: Need to clearly define the architectural boundaries and ensure consistent implementation

### 2. Device Discovery System

- **Issue**: Device discovery logic is scattered and tightly coupled with UI
- **Current State**:
  - Discovery logic in `DiscoveredDevices.vue`
  - Basic container in `DiscoveryView.vue`
  - Type issues with store integration
  - Redundant properties in `DiscoveredDevice` interface
- **Recommendation**:
  1. Create dedicated device discovery service
  2. Enhance UnifiedStore for device management
  3. Create new discovery UI component
  4. Refactor types and interfaces
  5. Integrate with new navigation system

### 3. Imaging Process

- **Issue**: Image processing logic is scattered across multiple components
- **Current State**:
  - Image acquisition in camera actions
  - Image processing in ASCOMImageBytes
  - UI updates in EnhancedCameraPanel
- **Recommendation**: Consolidate imaging process into a dedicated service layer

### 4. Legacy vs New Components

- **Issue**: Mix of legacy and new panel system components
- **Current State**:
  - Some components in `src/legacy-components/`
  - New panel system in `src/components/panels/`
  - Prototype implementations in `src/prototypes/`
- **Recommendation**: Need clear migration path and documentation of component status

### 5. Documentation Status

- **Current**: Multiple documentation files with varying levels of relevance
- **Relevant Docs**:
  - `docs/panel-system-design.md` - Current design
  - `docs/panel-system-implementation.md` - Implementation plan
  - `docs/events/event-system.md` - Event system documentation
- **Outdated/Needs Review**:
  - Some prototype documentation
  - Legacy component documentation

### 6. Logging System

- **Issue**: Multiple logging systems with limited functionality
- **Current State**:
  - Basic debug utilities in `debugUtils.ts`
  - Separate API logging in Alpaca client
  - No UI for log viewing
  - No log persistence
  - No filtering capabilities
- **Recommendation**:
  1. Create unified logging system
  2. Add debug panel UI
  3. Implement log persistence
  4. Add filtering and search
  5. Support different log levels

### 7. Type System and Property Mapping

- **Issue**: Incomplete mapping between ASCOM protocol properties and TypeScript interfaces
- **Current State**:
  - Legacy class implementations have comprehensive ASCOM property lists
  - New type system interfaces lack complete property coverage
  - No clear mapping between ASCOM property names and interface properties
  - Inconsistent property naming conventions
  - Missing validation for property values
- **Recommendation**:
  1. Create property mapping system
     - Define clear mapping between ASCOM and interface properties
     - Handle property name transformations
     - Support property value validation
     - Document mapping rules
  2. Enhance type system
     - Complete property coverage in interfaces
     - Add proper TypeScript types for all properties
     - Implement comprehensive type guards
     - Add property validation functions
  3. Create migration utilities
     - Tools to convert between legacy and new types
     - Property validation helpers
     - Type checking utilities
  4. Update documentation
     - Document property mapping rules
     - Add type system overview
     - Create migration guides
