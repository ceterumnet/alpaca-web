## Next Steps

1. Begin implementation of MainPanelsMigrated.vue following the established plan
2. Create comprehensive tests for MainPanelsMigrated.vue
3. Continue planning for Batch 4 & 5 components

## Overall Progress

The project has now reached approximately 67% completion, with all base components and device-specific components fully migrated. The migration of complex composition components is well underway, with DiscoveredDevices.vue and ManualDeviceConfig.vue now complete, and MainPanels.vue planning finished.

The migration approach of using batches based on component complexity has proven effective, allowing for incremental improvements while maintaining application functionality.
