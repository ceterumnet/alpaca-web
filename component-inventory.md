## Final Steps

All components have been successfully migrated! ðŸŽ‰

The project is now in the final phase:

1. **Integration Testing**

   - Verify all migrated components work together seamlessly
   - Ensure consistent behavior across different device types
   - Test navigation flows and component interactions

2. **Type Safety Review**

   - Verify TypeScript interfaces are consistent throughout the application
   - Eliminate any remaining `any` types where possible
   - Ensure store typings are accurate and complete

3. **Performance Optimization**

   - Identify and address any performance bottlenecks
   - Verify reactive dependencies are correctly established
   - Test the application under heavy loads

4. **Documentation Finalization**
   - Update API documentation for all migrated components
   - Create developer guides for the new architecture
   - Document common patterns and best practices
