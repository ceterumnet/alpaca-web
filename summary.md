## Conclusion

The project has made significant progress in modernizing the store architecture while maintaining backward compatibility. The approach of using an adapter layer has successfully allowed for incremental improvements without disrupting the existing application functionality. With comprehensive testing infrastructure now in place, including integration tests and performance benchmarks, we are well positioned in the Phase 2 migration to direct store usage.

1. **Integration Tests for Full Application Flows**

   - Created comprehensive `CompleteWorkflow.test.ts` for end-to-end testing
   - Implemented integration tests covering discovery, connection, and device control

2. **Performance Benchmarks**

   - Enhanced `AdapterPerformance.test.ts` with detailed metrics
   - Added memory usage measurements comparing adapter vs direct approach
   - Implemented component rendering performance tests
   - Analyzed and documented bundle size impact

3. **Real Device Testing Infrastructure**

   - Created a `DeviceSimulator` class for simulating real hardware
   - Implemented simulation for telescopes, cameras, and other devices
   - Developed a browser-based testing interface for manual testing
   - Created structured test scenarios covering various use cases

4. **Phase 2 Migration Execution**
   - Completed 8 out of 15 planned component migrations (53% complete)
   - Successfully finished Batch 1 and Batch 2 migrations
   - Prepared detailed migration steps for remaining components

## Recent Progress

We've completed the Phase 2 Batch 2, a significant milestone in our migration process:

1. **Component Migration Implementation**

   - Successfully completed 100% of Batch 2 components:
