## Conclusion

The project has made significant progress in modernizing the store architecture while maintaining backward compatibility. The approach of using an adapter layer has successfully allowed for incremental improvements without disrupting the existing application functionality. With comprehensive testing infrastructure now in place, including integration tests and performance benchmarks, we are well positioned to begin the Phase 2 migration to direct store usage.
